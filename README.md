LLM wrote the code. I haven't really read it yet but it was fun to play with.

Might do more with this later. 

How to use it:

`pip install requirements.txt`
`python play.py`

This will ask you to type your moves in the terminal.

It'll print the board in the terminal, but also try to open a browser window showing the board. I recommend resizing your windows so the terminal is next to the browser.
